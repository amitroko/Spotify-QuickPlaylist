# QuickPlaylist for Spotify

<https://spotify-quickplaylist.herokuapp.com>

With this tool, you can create a new Spotify playlist and instantly populate it with tracks you have recently played.
Tracks that you listened to for less than 30 seconds and your currently playing track will not be included.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
